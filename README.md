  Authentication Boilerplate Nest.JS üîê
</p>

## Description

[Nest](https://github.com/nestjs/nest) framework.

The project consists of an authentication pattern with Nest.JS. Using implementation of guards to manage access to API endpoints, as well as using a strategy, for this project an on-premises strategy was used, which involves configuring the main authentication flow, including user registration, login and token generation . This pattern will use Passport.js to handle authentication strategies and JWT (JSON Web Token) to secure the endpoints. And finally, the use of middleware to validate logins based on the credentials provided by the user.
